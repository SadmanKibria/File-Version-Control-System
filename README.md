# File Version Control System

## Overview

The Advanced File Version Control System is a robust and feature-rich software application designed to manage multiple versions of files, enabling users to track changes, compare versions, and merge alterations. This project showcases advanced programming skills in C, including memory management, data structures, and complex functionality implementation.

## Key Features

### 1. File Version Management

- The system allows users to create and manage multiple versions of files, making it a valuable tool for tracking changes over time.
- Each version is timestamped and includes a description of the changes, enhancing version history clarity.

### 2. User-Friendly Interface

- The command-line interface (CLI) is user-friendly, guiding users through version management, comparison, and merging operations.
- Clear and intuitive prompts ensure ease of use.

### 3. Version Comparison

- Users can compare two versions of a file to identify differences, facilitating detailed examination of changes.
- The comparison functionality highlights added, modified, and deleted content.

### 4. Version Merging

- The system allows users to merge two versions of a file, combining changes from different branches of development.
- Merged versions are intelligently generated, preserving the integrity of both source versions.

### 5. Error Handling and Data Validation

- The application includes robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage unexpected scenarios.
- Data validation ensures that user input remains within appropriate bounds, enhancing system reliability.

## Usage

1. **Compile the Code**: Compile the C source code using a C compiler, such as `gcc`:

`gcc advanced_file_version_control.c -o file_version_control`

2. **Run the Program**: Execute the compiled program:

`./file_version_control`

3. **Follow On-Screen Prompts**: The system will guide you through file version management, comparison, and merging operations. Follow the prompts for each task.

## Extensions and Future Enhancements

This project serves as a solid foundation for building more advanced version control systems. Here are some ideas for extending the project:

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Develop a graphical interface to enhance user accessibility.
- **Branch Management**: Implement branch management for parallel development and advanced version control strategies.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Enhance version merging with conflict resolution mechanisms.
- **Integration with External Tools**: Integrate the system with external text editors and development environments.
